# Colour

Colors are expressed using [HEX](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors\_hexadecimal.asp) or [RGBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA\_color\_model) .

## Background color

The background color can be set from the editor page> Appearance> Background> Add background color.

### Text color

You can set the text color from Editor Page> Appearance> Format> Color.

### Border color

The border color can be set in Editor Page> Appearance> Border> Color.

### RGBA value

You can specify the color as an RGBA value. RGB (red, green, blue) expresses colors at a ratio of 0 to 255. In the case of RGB (255,0,0), red is set to the maximum value (255), and the others are set to 0, so it is displayed as red.

### HEX value

It is represented by a 6-digit character string of 0 to 9 and a to f using a hexadecimal number called the HEX value. In some cases, it can be abbreviated to 3 digits.
