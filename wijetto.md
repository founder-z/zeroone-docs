# Widget

A widget is a group that can be used in multiple locations. This is useful if you use the same group frequently. Unlike \"styles\", where you can save a single element and make it the default, \"widgets\" can store a combination of multiple elements.

## Add widget

Widgets can be created by filling in \"Add Widget Name\" from the plus button to the left of \"Add Widget\". Elements added as widgets can be selected from Editor\> Palettes\> Custom.
